# IBM-Project
"Citizen AI is a Python-based web app using IBM Granite LLM, Gradio, Transformers, and Torch to analyze city safety (crime index, accidents) and answer public service queries. It offers real-time insights for smarter governance, safety analysis, and better citizen engagement through AI-powered responses."

Citizen AI – AI-powered City Analysis & Citizen Services
Overview

Citizen AI is an AI-powered web application built with IBM Granite LLM, Python, Gradio, Transformers, and Torch. It provides two main features:

City Analysis: Real-time insights on crime index, accident statistics, and overall city safety.

Citizen Services: AI-driven responses to public queries related to government policies, civic issues, and public services.

The app offers a simple and interactive interface for both citizens and policymakers to make data-driven decisions.
